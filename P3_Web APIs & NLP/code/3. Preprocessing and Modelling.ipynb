    "Accuracy score was chosen to be the evaluation metric for comparing model performances instead of other metrics such as precision, recall and specificity. Our goal of the project was to evaluate if our model is able to classify text data correctly, and the accuracy score represents the percentage of posts that were classified correctly to either r/datascience or r/digitalmarketing."

    "\n",
    "Based on the accuracy scores obtained from the various models, our choice of production model is the Support Vector Machine model using TF-IDF vectorization. While all the models performed reasonably well and outperformed the baseline model by a huge margin, the support vector machines model obtained the highest test accuracy score of 95.23% when the text data was vectorized with using the TF-IDF method. Although there was a slight overfitting issue with this model, it still managed to achieve the highest test accuracy score, and the difference in accuracy scores between training and testing sets was within reasonable range. \n",
    "\n",
    "Theory-wise, support vector machines are known to perform well with high-dimensional datasets, as in the case of our dataset comprising of large amounts of text data. The model could also potentially be computationally cheap as it utilizes the 'kernel trick' in which the model allows us to operate in the original feature space while doing the computation in a higher dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a downside. Support vector machines get much more computationally expensive as the dataset gets larger(more post submissions) as compared to the other models. Therefore for larger datasets, it may be wise to consider other models such as the Multinomial Naive Bayes which is computationally cheap without forgoing much performance."

This meant that for every 10,000 posts run through our model, we expect the model to predict 9523 posts correctly that they belonged to a particular subreddit.\n",

However, merely building the model is insufficient to achieve our project goal, as we are still unable to understand the current trend. Some additional work could be done to achieve this, such as collecting posts and/or comments within a particular time period(eg. 3 month period), and establishing if there were more submissions belonging to either subreddit, as well as to conduct a sentiment analysis to analyze user's perspective towards a particular topic."
